### SIC Code Analysis 

**SIC Codes**

**Think Tanks**

- List of Think Tanks were created from [On Think Tanks (OTT)](https://onthinktanks.org/).  See [OTT full dataset](https://airtable.com/app5Tu5McTOQC3pYw/shrnWdKAQxofzjZg4/tblr8Lc3OsoygJ7og).
- Political Wing was assigned to each Think Tank
- See [ThinkTanks](Wealtherty.ThinkTanks/Resources/ThinkTanks.csv)

**Notes**
- While the Fabian Society is included in the list of Think Tanks, it is exlucded from the list of Companies because, as an [unincorporated membership](https://fabians.org.uk/about-us/accountability/), it isn't registered at Companies House.
- Companies without any SIC Codes were ignored.
- Officers who are third-party service providers, typically Nominee Directors and Secretaries, were ignored.
- Unrecognised SIC Codes were ignored, eg 7260, 7499 and 8514.  We can only assume that these codes were once valid but company records weren't updated when they become invalid.
- Companies that are now dormant are moved to SIC Code 99999.  Unfortunately, we're unable to determine what their original values were.
