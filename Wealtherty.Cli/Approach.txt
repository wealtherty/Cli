Approach

Defined SIC Code data

- Parsed data from https://resources.companieshouse.gov.uk/sic/ to establish: Code, Category, Description
- See SicCodes.csv

Defined Think Tank data

- Sarah provided list of Think Tanks
- Used "On Think Tanks" to manually find the following properties for each Think Tank: founded-on date, website.  
	See https://airtable.com/app5Tu5McTOQC3pYw/shrnWdKAQxofzjZg4/tblr8Lc3OsoygJ7og
- Assigned Political wing to each Think Tank
- Created csv file. See v2_thinktanks.csv

Established Companies associated with each Think Thank

- For each Think Tank in vs_thinktanks.csv, manually find any associated companies (past or present) 
- Used various techniques to find companies:
	- Searched Companies House for Think Tank name, founder
	- Searched Think Tank website using various Google dorks
- Manually created list of Think Tank Compaies.  See v2_thinktanks_companies.csv.  

	!!! WARNING: This data has not be verified !!!

Established all appointments for all officers for all companies associated with Think Tanks

- Used Companies House API to programatically search for data
- For each Company in v2_thinktanks_companies.csv
	- Got the Company for the Think Tank
	- Ignored any Company that couldn't be found
	- Ignored any Company that didn't have any SIC Codes
	- Got all the Officers for the Company
	- For each Officer associated with the Think Tank Company
		- Ignored any Officer whose Role was to be ignored.  See below.
		- Got all the Appointments for the Officer.  This included not only the Company associated with the Think Tank, but all others
		- For each Appointment
			- Got the Company for the Appointment
			- Ignored any Appointment where the Company couldn't be found
			- Ignore any Appointment where the Company doesn't have any SIC codes
			- For each SIC Code associated with the Appointment Company
				- Ignored any SIC Code that couldn't be found				
				- Record all data associated with Think Tank, Company, Officer, Appointment, and SIC Code
		
- This approach duplicates data per Appointment where the Company has multiple SIC Codes
- This is the master set of data.  All other data sets mentioned below is a subset, or aggregate of this data.
- Stored data in csv file.  See all_appointments.csv
